Hero Quote: Ah, Wisp, your mordant wit is wasted on these gross beings.*Puck
Hero Quote: Ah, gambits and exploits await.*Puck
Hero Quote: Ah, nothing like the feel of a fresh molt.*Puck
Hero Quote: An item of no small merit.*Puck
Hero Quote: Did you mean to elude me?*Puck
Hero Quote: Excellent, an apparition of exceptional age. What I wonder can it teach me.*Puck
Hero Quote: First Blood! It shall be duly noted.*Puck
Hero Quote: Fresh from death's chrysalis!*Puck
Hero Quote: From what primordial eon does the rock of Tiny hail?*Puck
Hero Quote: Green you may be, but I find you tiresome.*Puck
Hero Quote: Grievous misunderstanding!*Puck
Hero Quote: Hatched on a frond of the Undertree, I devoured leaf, stalk, root and all of my sibs.  Yet, only halfway through this Eon, I already hunger for more!*Puck
Hero Quote: I am done contemplating imponderables.*Puck
Hero Quote: I am unfamiliar with this feeling. Is it joy?*Puck
Hero Quote: I do enjoy an occasional blink.*Puck
Hero Quote: I find myself strangely drawn to this odd configuration of activity.*Puck
Hero Quote: I had not expected to be reborn for another million years.*Puck
Hero Quote: I have been to Claszureme. They still speak of their relief at being rid of you.*Puck
Hero Quote: I learned nothing from close observation of Tinker's demise.*Puck
Hero Quote: I may require this at some point.*Puck
Hero Quote: I measure the cost in lives.*Puck
Hero Quote: I remember that one from some time long past.*Puck
Hero Quote: I return to the active world.*Puck
Hero Quote: I sense this book of yours may be full of erroneous information.*Puck
Hero Quote: I wield this scepter with authority.*Puck
Hero Quote: If you are truly some sort of dragon, you must be a juvenile form.*Puck
Hero Quote: It would seem that almost anything can call itself a dragon in this age.*Puck
Hero Quote: Let the world end now, it matters not to me.*Puck
Hero Quote: Life can never be too long!*Puck
Hero Quote: May you ride on nether zephyrs!*Puck
Hero Quote: My pleasure at this finding fractures the lenses of the real.*Puck
Hero Quote: One and one and one is three!*Puck
Hero Quote: Regrettably, I remove myself from sight.*Puck
Hero Quote: Rumor speaks of the Lone Druid as an ancient one, yet here I see barely a sprat.*Puck
Hero Quote: So this is gold's purpose.*Puck
Hero Quote: Someone chose a poor time to put me out of commission.*Puck
Hero Quote: Strange transformation…*Puck
Hero Quote: That one admired my wings but could not be trusted to care for her own.*Puck
Hero Quote: That was an exceedingly odd metamorphosis.*Puck
Hero Quote: That's for your impertinence.*Puck
Hero Quote: The Scrolls of Haize are concise on this matter: With youth comes grave responsibility.  A thousand years of youth have fallen behind, and still I fill the time with games.*Puck
Hero Quote: The greatest tragedy of our eon.*Puck
Hero Quote: The worth of this gift is mine to plumb.*Puck
Hero Quote: This might prove a sport of some interest.*Puck
Hero Quote: This should be less tiresome than another age in chrysalis.*Puck
Hero Quote: Three can play at this game.*Puck
Hero Quote: To be a true enigma, it would be best to style oneself on something less studied than gravity.*Puck
Hero Quote: Unnerving. I understood every word.*Puck
Hero Quote: We two did sport, but in the end she tired.*Puck
Hero Quote: Were you a bud of the Undertree, we could be no better companions.*Puck
Hero Quote: What is this nature you speak of?*Puck
Hero Quote: What is this, a game of some sort?*Puck
Hero Quote: What the Outworld represents, and why one would destroy it, is now a quandary that intrigues me.*Puck
Hero Quote: What's this? A fascinating substance.*Puck
Hero Quote: Why, this is as good as a continual molt!*Puck
Hero Quote: Will you not rise in my presence?*Puck
Hero Quote: Wisp, I disagree with your alliance, yet you do make a compelling argument.*Puck
Hero Quote: Wisp, I think you are too bold.*Puck
Hero Quote: Wisp, you are like a thought I once had but dismissed out of hand.*Puck
Hero Quote: You are a sluggish creature, Slardar.*Puck
Hero Quote: You might wish to retract your last move.*Puck
Hero Quote: You took that jape too far.*Puck
Hero Quote: Your actions are without merit.*Puck
Hero Quote: Your comments cut me to the quick.*Puck
Hero Quote: Ah, choice cut of wolf steak.*Pudge
Hero Quote: As if one of me wasn't already more than enough.*Pudge

Hero Quote: Ah, what's good for me is bad for thee.*Pugna
Hero Quote: All sorceries have their source in the Nether Reaches.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Always wanted one of these.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Anti-Mage, it's like looking in a broken mirror.*Pugna
Hero Quote: As bad as things get, I can always come up with a way to make them a little worse.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Back to the Nether Reaches with you, Viper!*Pugna
Hero Quote: Black King Bar, you are mine.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Blasted that tower to smithereens.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Do you know why they call it the Nether Reaches? Because it reaches into you.*Pugna

Hero Quote: This wasn't part of the plan.*Pugna
Hero Quote: Time to earn myself a bad reputation.*Pugna
Hero Quote: To Anti-Mage, with my compliments.*Pugna

Hero Quote: Where mind meets matter, those are the temple steps from which the mysteries may be glimpsed.*Templar Assassin
Hero Quote: Where the Hidden Ones send me, I go without question. I do not even question why I question not.*Templar Assassin
Hero Quote: You almost had our secrets, so we could not let you live.*Templar Assassin
